# MNIST Classification using ANN and CNN 🌐💡

This repository demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits (0-9) from the **MNIST dataset** using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. ✨

## Key Highlights 🔎
- Implements both **ANN** and **CNN** models for image classification.
- Achieved **97.51% accuracy** with ANN and **98.71% accuracy** with CNN. 🚀
- Includes data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation metrics like precision and recall.

## Dataset 📃
- **Source**: Provided by Keras.
- **Description**: 70,000 grayscale images (28x28) of handwritten digits labeled 0-9.

## Why This Project? 🤔
To explore the power of deep learning architectures in image classification and compare the performance of basic ANN models versus advanced CNN models.

## Acknowledgments 👏
Special thanks to **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, and the creators of the **MNIST dataset** for making this project possible!
